### <a name="Upstream">Upstream</a>

Description: 
Upstreams represent destination for routing HTTP requests. Upstreams can be compared to
[clusters](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v1/cluster_manager/cluster.html?highlight=cluster) in Envoy terminology.
Each upstream in Gloo has a type. Supported types include `static`, `kubernetes`, `aws`, `consul`, and more.
Each upstream type is handled by a corresponding Gloo plugin.

```yaml
"upstream_spec": .gloo.solo.io.UpstreamSpec
"status": .core.solo.io.Status
"metadata": .core.solo.io.Metadata
"discovery_metadata": .gloo.solo.io.DiscoveryMetadata

```
